Hacking

>A hacker is someone who loves to make stuff and is fascinated by complex systems, which they enjoy creating, extending and subverting.
_Andy Hertzfeld, MAC WIZARD, GOOGLE ENGINEER_

>“Hacker” is a word whose meaning forks both positively and negatively, like “fuck” — many of those who call themselves hackers are brilliant programmers with ideals, others are brilliant programmers with nefarious intent. The public will never understand.
_Ted Nelson, AUTHOR, CREATOR OF XANADU_
